Project Description: 

We will be creating a web application (Workaholic) that enables people to cooperate on projects and distribute/assign tasks among team members. The application will offer built-in online chatting functions that enables its users to communicate through private chats and public chatting rooms. The chatting function wonâ€™t be accessible to new users unless they register an account. 

There will be two types of users: 

team members and project managers:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Team members will be able to accept tasks and record their progression on the shared group page. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Project managers will be able to see the work progress of team members within individual projects groups and assign new tasks as the project goes. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Everyone on the team will be able to see the overall project progress through their account dashboard.

The application also supports the communication between members, from managers to team members, from team members to team members. Managers could keep track of the progress of all team members and the overall progress of the whole project, while team members could only see the progress of their individual progress of their assigned task.

Functionalities:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Use Multithread for chatbox communication between group members

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Use HTML and CSS for the stunning user interface

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* We will figure out a way for the backend database storage

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* We will write at least one back-end server in java
